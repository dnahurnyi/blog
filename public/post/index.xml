      <description>Sync package primitives explained.  Recently I have visited GopherConEU 2019 that took place on the beautiful Canary Islands, Tenerife. I have presented my lightning talk about sync package primitives and how to use them, in my case to manage attraction in an amusement park. This post will try to help in case you want to explore sync package or missed something from my talk.   When you build your program, usually you have complete concept, idea that you understand, so with input in one place, you always can tell where will be the output.</description>
